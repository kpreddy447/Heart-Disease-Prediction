# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts house prices using machine learning models. It uses housing data, such as lot size, number of rooms, year built, and location, to build predictive models. Additionally, a user-friendly interface is included for easy interaction with the model.

---

## What This Project Is About
- **Goal**: Predict house prices based on various housing features.
- **Approach**: Data is preprocessed, analyzed, and used to train machine learning models, which users can interact with through a simple web-based interface.

---

## What Was Done
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing data and outliers.
   - Standardized features for better model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized feature distributions and their relationship with house prices.
   - Correlation analysis to understand key features.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Trained models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Evaluated using RMSE and R² scores.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The trained models are used to predict house prices on new input data.

5. **User Interface**:
   - A web-based UI was developed using Streamlit.
   - Users can input housing features to get price predictions instantly.
   - The interface also visualizes the prediction results and provides insights into key features.
